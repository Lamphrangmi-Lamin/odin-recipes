    <p> Rich and tender with a lovely vanilla flavor, these cute cutouts are sure to catch Santa's eye when you leave him a plateful! It wouldn't be Christmas without these expected treats. —Jane Grosvold, Holcombe, Wisconsin.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened </li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar </li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream </li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>6 ½ cups cake flour </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Step 1</span>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Step 2</span>
            <p>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream and vanilla. Stir in baking soda, baking powder and salt; gradually mix in flour to form a dough that is stiff enough to roll out. More or less flour may be necessary.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Step 3</span>
            <p>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into shapes using cookie cutters. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Step 4</span>
            <p>Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and the center appears dry. Cookies will stay white, so be careful not to overbake.
