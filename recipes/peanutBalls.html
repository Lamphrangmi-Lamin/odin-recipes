    <p> Peanut Butter Balls are a perfect example of how something that tastes really good can also be easy to make. The best way to describe their flavor is to say they are like a homemade Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They have that same lovely coating of dark chocolate, with a smooth and creamy peanut butter filling that is almost fudge-like in texture.</p>
